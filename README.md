Personal Blog Website

Currently use
- prism.js for syntax highlighting
- showdown.js for converting md to html

Thing I need to do
- create a personal website landing page
- hosts the post in a better way
- join the scripts to create a single publishing script

The unfortunate current process for creating a blog post
- create the document in markdown
- convert from md to html
- prepend layout to html
- append data to posts.js
